  <description><![CDATA[<b>More Faction Interaction</b>

Adds more interaction with and between factions, bringing the world to life.

<b>Meaningful faction relations</b>
- Build up trust and factions will reward you
- Cement relations by inter-faction marriages
- Help factions recover from different setbacks
- Factions may call upon you for labour
- Favours for favours
- Increased rate of world events

<b>Trade improvements</b>
- Specialised traders desperate for certain goods
- More frequent traders, if you treat them right
- Traders get richer as you build up trust
- Traders bring higher quality as relations increase

<b>A living world</b>
- Pirates spread out and grow outposts
- Pirates can demand tribute if they're close by - destroy their outposts!
- Show off your skills at the yearly exposition. Maybe you'll do well and be invited to host next year?
- Roadworks. To strengthen ties and increase trade, your allies can build roads as a nice silver sink.
- Squatters! Someone found a use for an old deserted settlement.

<b>Warring factions</b>
- Unrest is brewing between two factions! Will you pick a side, stay neutral or profiteer?

<b>TL;DR: More events</b>
- Diplomatic marriages
- Reverse trade requests
- Bumper crops
- Hunter's Lodge
- Pirate extortion
- Mystical Shaman
- Annual Expo
- Squatters
