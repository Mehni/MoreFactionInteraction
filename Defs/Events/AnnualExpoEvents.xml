        <outcomeFirstLoser>There was a strong field of contenders this year, with many faction representatives having lived as a hunter or just plain decked out in (archotech) bionics.

        <outComeFirstOther>[PAWN_nameDef] did not proceed past the first round, which consisted of "hit the broad side of a barn". They added that part as a gag years ago.

        <outComeFirstPlace>As the last of daylight slowly dimmed away, [PAWN_nameDef] simply sat down on a granite stool and told of [PAWN_possessive] upbringing as a [PAWN_title]. This simple story and more importantly the atmosphere [PAWN_pronoun] created was lauded by judges for its intimacy, originality and bravery. Your reward for participating is:\n\n{0}</outComeFirstPlace>
        <outcomeFirstLoser>Not being better prepared or having brought anything, your caravan broke out in a song and dance routine with [PAWN_nameDef] taking centre stage. It wasn't well-rehearsed, which shone through the performance. Not all participating factions were able to appreciate the improvised show, but it was an admirable effort nonetheless. Your reward for participating is:\n\n{0}</outcomeFirstLoser>
        <outComeFirstOther>The host faction moved the audience to tears with their dazzling display; a dramatic reenactment of their ancestor's discovery of White Rabbit Mountain Range. It was a touching piece of theatre that transcended language barriers, and reached the hearts of young and old alike.\n\nAnd then there was your troupe.

        <outcomeFirstLoser>The expo turned out to be a very cosy get-together, spent jamming on guitars. Someone played Wonderwall but other than that it was a pretty chill evening that put everybody in a good mood. Your reward for coming is:\n\n{0}</outcomeFirstLoser>
        <outComeFirstOther>One of your caravan members picked up an instrument they shouldn't have and, not being musically gifted, broke a string while fingering a minor. Apologies were made but it wasn't sufficient: your klutzy caravan member was to work as a stage-hand on the night of the performance. Since a good time was still had by all, they were given the after-party leftovers:\n\n{0}</outComeFirstOther>
