They've picked a neutral nearby location and invite you to come negotiate.\n\nIt could be a great opportunity to improve relations with their faction, but beware - a poor negotiator can cause more harm than good and even anger them.\n\nThe offer will expire after {3} days, after which [PAWN_nameDef] fears the worst.</letterText>
